The photo looked great, so he posted it online and took a shower.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, both were shocked. Steph's photo, once beautiful, now showed eggs with flies and dry flowers. Matt's body looked like it was covered in dirty oil. They tried to delete the photos, but couldn't. Then they received a message from the app developer:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Dear User,</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Are you as beautiful inside as outside? If you want your pictures to show the real you, try being truly beautiful in real life.</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>PS. Once you use our filter (滤镜), all your future photos will have it automatically (自动地)!</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;To hide the ugly picture, Steph made her account (账号) private. Depressed and feeling like something was missing, Steph went downstairs and met Mrs. Robinson in her garden. Without anything else to do, Steph helped her there. The following couple of hours made her feel happy again.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Later, Mrs. Robinson suggested they take a photo together. Steph liked it very much and wanted to share it. She made her account public again and posted it with the text: \"Me and my neighbor in her garden #TrueBeauty.\" To her surprise, the photo stayed just as it was--natural and warm.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Matt, one of Steph's followers, saw her post and understood something. He offered to help his neighbor take out the rubbish. At the bins, he took a smiling selfie and posted it with the same hashtag. His photo also showed something truly beautiful.</p>",

            "content": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The moon has two very different sides. The side facing Earth, called the near side, is dark with large, flat areas. These flat regions are remains of ancient lava flows (熔岩流) that happened billions of years ago. The far side, which always faces away from Earth, is the opposite. It has more mountains and craters (陨石坑), making it look rocky.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For many years, scientists wondered why the two sides differ so much. Recently, a team led by NASA scientist Ryan Park found the answer lies under the moon's surface.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The team used data (数据) from the mission called GRAIL. In 2011 and 2012, two spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, orbited (绕轨道飞行) the moon for a year. Their job was to measure (测量) how the moon bends because of Earth's gravity (地球引力). Like a soft ball that changes shape when squeezed (挤压), the moon bends (弯曲) slightly as it moves around Earth. This tiny movement gives clues about its interior (内部).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Park said, \"At first, we couldn't believe the data and checked it many times.\" The near side is warmer inside, which may make its rocks soft and allow more bending. The far side is cooler and harder, so it bends less. This difference explains why the two sides look so different.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This discovery helps us understand other planets too. Scientists have used this method to study Jupiter and the asteroid (小行星) Vesta. By observing how these bodies respond to gravity, scientists learn about their internal layers (内层), such as whether they have liquid or solid (固体或液体) parts. Park added, \"This method will help explore many planetary bodies in our solar system.\" This new knowledge improves our understanding of planet formation (形成) and change.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next time you look at the moon, remember its two faces tell a story about what lies beneath (在......下面).</p>",

            "content": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;① On April 13, 2025, China made a very important step in global communication technology. It set up the first 6G test network in the world with communication, intelligence, and sensing (感应) all in one. Purple Mountain Laboratory (紫金山实验室) developed this in Nanjing. This is a big jump from just having ideas about 6G to testing it in the real world.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;② The new 6G network can do two things. It can communicate and also sense like a radar (雷达). The base stations are both signal (信号) senders and \"smart radars\". They use wireless (无线) signals to find objects. For example, when testing drones (无人机), these stations could find the exact locations, speeds, and heights of three drones. The mistake was less than or equal to 3cm. Compared with 5G, the 6G network is more than 10 times faster in communication. And each base station can support up to 1 million devices(设备).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;③ This technology will change our daily life. In close-to-the-ground delivery, drones can bring goods much faster. A 7.4-km delivery only takes 13 minutes, which is three times more efficient. For the safety of cities, it can find illegal (违法的) drones in 5 seconds. This helps keep the airspace safe. In smart cities, traffic lights can change by themselves using real-time road information. In some test areas like Beijing, traffic jams dropped by 35%.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;④ China wants to be the leader in global 6G standards (标准). It plans to start using 6G for business by 2030. This project also helps other industries, like satellite (卫星) networks and devices that use AI. Professor You Xiaohu, a famous scientist, said, \"6G will change how people stay in touch. It's not just about being fast, but also about helping us know more about the world around us.\"</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;⑤ This new development shows that China is becoming more and more important in high-tech. It gives us a look at a future where networks are faster, smarter, and work better together than ever.</p>",

Why?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two ways <input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" /> colors. One is through pigments (染料). Pigments show the color of light they <input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" /> take in. Chlorophyll, a green pigment in plants, makes leaves green--it reflects green light <input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" /> taking in blue and red.

And there's <input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" /> \"true blue\" pigment in plants.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" /> way is structural color. It happens when a surface's structure changes light colors. Like the rainbow colors on a CD. Blueberries use structural color, <input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" />. Ripe berries look darker blue, because a thin wax layer (only 0.004 cm thick) on their skin makes them blue. This blue attracts birds to eat the berries and spread seeds.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now your bowl of blueberries suddenly looks <input type=\"underline\" size=\"8\" readonly=\"readonly\" /> more interesting.

He also read hundreds of medical books and collected different kinds of herbs. After 27 years of efforts, his Ben Cao Gang Mu was completed in 1578.
